I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want

Come, lay me down
'Cause you know this
'Cause you know this sound

In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night
I'm wide awake, I crave your taste
All night long 'til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine, you gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night, oh
